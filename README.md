Website for wife and her hair styling business. HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

This project really pushed the boundaries of what I felt I could do at the time.  There was a LOT I had to look up and research to get it where it is now.  The gallery is constantly being added to, but I may do an over haul of it at some point. It's already a little slow loading all of the images.
